# Web Assembly build of FLINT: fast library for number theory

This automates the process of building MPFR, GMP, and [FLINT](http://www.flintlib.org/f) as WASM libraries using emscripten, so they could be used in a web application or from node.js.  This thus creates cross platform wasm binaries that make the functionality of FLINT available to node.js or any modern web browser.  Currently you might use this by writing a C/C++ program that relies on FLINT, and links in the libraries built using the recipe here, then building that for deployment on the web using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

## Quickstart

This will download and build the three libraries, assuming you have [installed the emscripten toolchain.](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

This should take less than a half hour.  They get installed into `build/local` .

## Test a program using FLINT

There are examples in `build/flint-2.7.1/examples` .  For example,  to build `primegen`, do this:

```sh
$ emcc primegen.c -o primegen.js -L$PREFIX/lib -I$PREFIX/include/flint -I$PREFIX/include -lflint -lmpfr -lgmp
```

To run it from node.js:

```sh
$ node primegen.js 20
```

The same instructions should work with any other program there, except for cpp, use `em++`:

```sh
$ em++ partitions.cpp -o partitions.js -L$PREFIX/lib -I$PREFIX/include/flint -I$PREFIX/include -lflint -lmpfr -lgmp
$ time node partitions.js 100093982083408923

```

Note: use the option `-s INITIAL_MEMORY=2146435072` to `emcc` if you want to use more than a tiny amount of RAM.
